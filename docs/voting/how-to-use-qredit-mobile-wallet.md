# How to Use the Qredit Mobile Wallet

The Qredit Mobile Wallet is an easy to use, portable application. It enables you to manage all of your Qredit accounts and the XQR coins inside of it. It lets you send and receive transactions, vote for a delegate or register as a delegate. The wallet also provides an interface to add contacts by their address, which can save you some time when making transactions.

The application is built using the Ionic Framework, which enables the code base to be reused, keeping similar functionally and looks, for both iOS and Android.

## Installation

Like any useful application, you will be able to find the Qredit Mobile Wallet application in your phone's store. It is entirely free to download and use.

Download the wallet from the [App Store](http://qredit.io/go/ios) or the [Google Play Store](https://qredit.io/go/android).

### Starting the Qredit Wallet

Once you load the application you will be met with this screen:

The content of each slide shares some details about some security and usability features of the app.

After reading through the welcome slides, you will be able to create a profile.

After you hit the **_Create A Profile_** button, you will be prompted to create a six-digit PIN confirm it afterward.

::: warning
It is imperative that you remember this PIN.

Your new profile must then be assigned a name and a network. Mainnet is the one where your XQR will be sent to and from. The Devnet is used for team members and contributors wishing to test additional functionality and should not be used. The remainder of this document assumes you've created a profile that uses the Mainnet.

Once you have entered your name, you can sign in by touching the profile you created and by entering the PIN you created earlier. From there, you can click on the bottom-right button to either create or import a wallet. If you are importing a wallet, click [here](#importing-a-wallet). If you are creating a new wallet, continue reading.

### Creating a wallet

If you choose to generate a wallet, follow the prompts and you should be shown your shareable Public Address and your Secret Passphrase.

::: warning
Keep your secret passphrase safe and secure, without it, you will not be able to restore your wallet, and you will lose access to your XQR coins.
:::

After hitting **_Next_**, you will be asked to verify your Secret Passphrase. Your PIN will be required to encrypt your address.

The next screen will show you the amount of XQR you have in your wallets, your shareable Public Address, the Market Value of XQR in USD, Satoshis, and the 24-hour Change.

### Importing a wallet

If you choose to import a wallet and follow the prompts, you will have three options to import your wallet: Using a QR Code, by putting in your secret passphrase or to add your address. Please note that the last option will make the wallet Read-only, since the app doesnt know the private key.

::: warning
If you decide to copy and paste your information into the app, make sure your device does not add a space after your passphrase or address. If a space is there, it will create a new wallet and not import your wallet.
